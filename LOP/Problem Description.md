The linear ordering problem (LOP) has a wide range of applications in several fields, such as scheduling, sports, social sciences, and economics. Due to its combinatorial nature, it has been shown to be _NP_-hard [[5](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/0-306-48332-7_260#ref-CR5_0-306-48332-7_260 "Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S.: Computers and intractability: A guide to the theory of NP-completeness, Freeman, 1979.")]. Like many other computationally hard problems, the linear ordering problem has captured the researcher attention for developing efficient solution procedures. A comprehensive treatment of the state-of-art approximation algorithms for solving the linear order problem is contained in [[15](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/0-306-48332-7_260#ref-CR15_0-306-48332-7_260 "Reinelt, G.: ‘The linear ordering problem: Algorithms and applications’, in H.H. Hofmann, and R. Wille (eds.): Res. and Exposition in Math., 8, Heldermann, 1985.")]. The scope of this article is to introduce the reader to this problem, providing its definition and some of the algorithms proposed in literature for solving it efficiently.

The linear ordering problem (LOP) can be formulated as follows: Given a _complete digraph_ _D_ _n_ = (_V_ _n_ , _E_ _n_ ) on _n_ nodes and given arc weights _c_(_i_, _j_) for each arc (_i_, _j_) ∈ _E_ _n_ , find a _spanning acyclic tournament_ in _D_ _n_ such that the sum of the weights of its arcs is as large as possible.
